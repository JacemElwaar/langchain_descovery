Definition : 
    Large Language Models (LLMs) are advanced machine learning models that excel in a wide 
range of language-related tasks such as text generation, translation, summarization, 
question answering, and more, without needing task-specific tuning for every scenario.
The newest generation of chat models offer additional capabilities: 
- Tool calling => API
- Structued output: respond in a JSON that matches given schema
- Multimodality : working with data other than text; images, audio and video  


Key methods: 
- invoke : interract with the chat model
- stream : stream the output of a chat model once generated 
- batch : **batch multiple requests to a chat model together for more efficient processing
- bind_tools : bind tool to a chat model for use in the model's execution context.
- with_structured_output : a wrapper around the invoke method for models that natively support structured output 


Input & output 

- langchain Message format: 
- OpenAI's Message format: format put in place with OpenAI 

Standard parameters  : 
chat models have standardized parameters that can be used to configure the model : 
https://python.langchain.com/docs/concepts/chat_models/ 

Tool calling  
- Tools can be external api, api we currently use, permanent static data etc ...
- Short story agents will use tools to perform tasks.  


Advanced topics: 
- Rate limiting : Many chat model providers impose a limit on the number of requests that can be made in a given time period 

Caching  
- Chat model can be slow can be slow so caching previous responses can be usefull
